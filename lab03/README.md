The image below is a breadboard of a health checklist feature we plan to add to our app.
  
This feature will allow users to quickly communicate their current status to doctors and nurses on the pre-surgery prep work they have been doing, and this will help determine if they are ready for the surgury or if they are not compatible to have the surgury done at this time.
