# Summary of podcast
- "Shape Up" refers to 37signals' product development philosophy, which emphasizes a methodical approach to creating software solutions. This methodology's central idea is the notion of a "pitch." A pitch is a brief document, usually 800 words or less, that serves as a directive, explaining the issue to be resolved and providing a high-level solution. It is not a complete specification, but rather a place to start, allowing for original problem-solving throughout the development process. Customer feedback is used to inform pitches, which seek to enhance products with new functions or features.
- Prior to pitching, there is a vital stage called "framing," in which the issue is described without mentioning a specific solution. This stage gives context for the pitch and aids in issue clarification. Although consumers are very good at recognizing problems, pitches fill the gap by providing specific answers and making sure that the team developing the solution is fully aware of the issue.
- The project team should have a sense of autonomy, mastery, and purpose after hearing pitches. They lay out the issue, define the ideal resolution, provide restrictions (no-nos), and point out probable detours (rabbit holes). Rabbit holes are enticing but unsuccessful routes that might cause attention to be drawn away from the main task. To keep a clear sense of purpose, "shaping" a project essentially involves choosing what to work on and what not to.
- A important stage before pitching is termed "framing," in which the issue is named and addressed without providing a remedy. This stage gives context for the pitch and aids in issue clarification. Although consumers are very good at recognizing problems, pitches fill the gap by providing specific answers and making sure that the team developing the solution is fully aware of the issue.
- Lastly, "science projects" are like macro-level rabbit holes; they may require too much time and money. A "spike" is a brief period of time devoted to investigating a problem and determining if it can be solved. By following these guidelines, "Shape Up" encourages a simple, efficient method of product development that emphasizes problem-solving, creative freedom, and upholding a distinct sense of purpose throughout the undertaking.
